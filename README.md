Image Processor
A Python script to separate landscape and portrait photos from a folder.

Description
This Python script is designed to separate portrait and landscape photos in a folder. While working on a project to add watermarks to event photographs using Adobe Photoshop, I encountered issues with the script due to the different orientations of the images. Without separating them, the process was a mess and very time-consuming. So, I created this Python script to automate the separation of photos based on their orientation.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pillow library
You can install Pillow using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pillow
Usage
Download this Python script.
Run the script. It will ask for the directory where the folder with images is located.
Provide the path to the folder.
The script will create two subfolders: landscape and portrait, and separate the photos accordingly.
